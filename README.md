# custom-http-client

This project is a personal project to show how we can have custom http client built inside angular projects. This helps to modularize
the angular code, especially when we do not want to write redundant code . 

The project is inspired from ideas in opensource space with a bit of customizations. The actual project was built in stackblitz but thought of pushing the code to 
stash as it might help for people who are looking to fork for some ideas in this corner. 

ng s will help to bring the application up after npm install.
